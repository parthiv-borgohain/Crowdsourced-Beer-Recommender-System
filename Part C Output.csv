9,Bourbon County Brand Stout ,"stouts, especially imperial stouts, are my favorite style, so i try them whenever i can. even though bourbon county changes slightly every year, for me it is the zenith, the benchmark against all others are judged. the viscosity is delightful; other imperial stouts are so thin and weak by comparison. and the complexity is amazing. i introduce people to it every year, give them a small glassful without introduction and ask them what they think they are drinking. people are always fascinated by the range of flavors, and only a few guess that it is a beer!', '\nevery year, my friends and i buy up as much as we can get our hands on. and if you can find it on tap, i like it even better.",0.0

"", '\n', ""\npours an almost unbelievable glowing ruby red - i'm talking the sorcerer's stone red. highly polished, highly reflective, mesmerising to stare at glowing ruby gemstone red - clear, but not crystal. a finger of quick, loose, just-slightly-pink head builds up, and then quickly reduces to a thin soapy collar. some slow effervescence can be seen. "", '\n', ""\nnose: there are average cherry wild ales, and there are cherry wild ales that you can just tell are something incredible by the aroma. this is in the latter category. the amount of cherry on the nose is borderline unreal and saturated, while being entirely organic in nature. not only is this a cherry bomb aroma, but what is really impressive is how both the montmorency and the balaton cherries seem to translate. there is some intensely sweet, ripe, juicy balaton character, lending an almost maraschino cherry on top of a maraschino liqueur note, bursting with big, deep, dark cherry juice, while the montmorency cherries lend that floral, fresh, tangy cherry note, with a touch of stem, pit, and even cherry blossom. there is also a healthy amount of oak, and, along with the cherries, seems to lend this subtle cinnamon spice note, with just a whisper of oaky vanillins. there is a suggestion of acidity, but it doesn't singe the nose when inhaling, and there's very little earthy or barnyard funk. just some wet oak, leather, old parchment, dusty attic, and a hint of brett. the cherries obscure any real serious funk or acidity that may lie beneath. there's a touch of gently toasty grain beneath everything, which is the icing on the cake. "", '\n', ""\npalate: first thing, from the very first sip, it isn't bracing sourness that hits, it isn't tannic oak, it isn't malt, it's sweet and tart ripe cherry flesh. the deep, bold balaton sweetness greets the palate, giving up its sweet juicy goodness, while never coming across as artificial, cough syrupy, sticky, or overly sweet. this sweet cherry juice flavour unfurls to eventually reveal the montmorency character beneath. the montmorency is not quite as deep, bold, and saturated with juicy sweetness, but it provides a slightly less ripe, slightly fruitier character, that brings japanese cherry blossom, a bit of plum, a hint of cherry potpourri, cinnamon/amburana wood spice, and a bright, natural, almost slightly unripe cherry tartness to the table. in addition to this subtle fruity tartness, the acidity lends a near-perfect degree of sour. it really isn't bracing, puckering, or blinding in any way. make no mistake, this is a sour ale, no question about it, but it isn't midwest sour. there is some lemony lacto pucker, a bit less of some acetic pedio bite, and a bit more of some tart, funky, mineralic brett, lending not quite salinity, and definitely not sweat, but that classic restrained brett tang, along with some musty wet wood, a little hint of bandaid, and that classic bretty stone fruit pit note. the high degree of minerality paired with the bandaid note and the deep cherry really gives this a little hint of a kriek vibe. the tartness has a quick downward curve, allowing some really wonderful oak to appear before the finish, paired with a hint of vanilla, a hint of baking spice, a hint of caramel, and a hint of brown sugar. the sourness takes a far back seat, revealing some more dusty brett, and then finally, the ever-so-slightly sweet toasted grain base reveals itself, with a wonderful melding of grainy wheat and round malty barley, cereal grains, essence of cherry, and gently tannic oak linger on and conclude the finish. "", '\n', ""\nmouthfeel/body: mvb is light, crisp, and snappy by nature, though the mild to moderate cherry sweetness and slight bit of malt body push this a bit closer to medium-bodied territory. effervescence is surprisingly low. it isn't flat, but rather lazy and slow. one might expect this to be a super fizzy, champagne-like experience, but that is not the case, which also contributes to a slightly fuller feel. soft, round, and even quite juicy upfront, the ale is not scrubbing, and even feels somewhat smooth. the oak in the finish provides some tannicdrying as the sweetness fades, but the ale itself isn't tannic or ultra-dry. "", '\n', '\noverall: this is a really remarkable cherry wild ale, and an absolute triumph from jester king. the perceivable differences between the montmorency and balaton cherries is a work of art, and the structure, balance, and progression of the ale is nothing short of impressive. the acidity is forward, but kept in check, the sweetness makes a statement up front, and then takes a supporting role, the oak and microflora influence walks a tightrope right down the middle of balanced, and the subtle malty, grainy base beneath it all is something that i always look for, but rarely get in highly acidic ales. this is just absolutely world class.",0.0
